# Payroll System Audit Report 2025

## Executive Summary

This audit report documents the comprehensive review and fixes applied to the BengoERP payroll system to ensure compliance with the latest Kenyan tax regulations effective February 2025. The audit was conducted by comparing the current system calculations against the official PNA.co.ke calculator.

## Audit Scope

- **Period**: September 2025 payroll calculations
- **Reference**: PNA.co.ke Kenya PAYE Tax Calculator (Effective Feb 2025)
- **Test Case**: Employee Thomas Aaron Wilson, Basic Pay KES 49,784.00
- **Focus Areas**: Tax calculations, deductions, reliefs, and net pay computation

## Critical Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Tax Calculation Logic Errors**

#### Issue Description
The original payroll system had fundamental flaws in the tax calculation flow:
- Variables were not properly initialized before use
- Tax relief application was incorrect
- Missing proper integration of NSSF, SHIF, and Housing Levy calculations

#### Fixes Implemented
- **File**: `ERPAPI/hrm/payroll/utils.py`
- **Method**: `process_regular_payroll()`
- **Changes**:
  - Properly initialized all deduction variables
  - Integrated NSSF, SHIF, and Housing Levy calculations into main flow
  - Fixed tax relief application logic
  - Corrected net pay calculation

#### Code Changes
```python
# Before: Variables not initialized
tier_1_nssf=tier_2_nssf=nssf_employer_contribution=nhif_employee_contribution=hslevy_employee_contribution=Decimal('0')

# After: Proper initialization and calculation
tier_1_nssf=tier_2_nssf=nssf_employer_contribution=Decimal('0')
nhif_employee_contribution=hslevy_employee_contribution=Decimal('0')

# Calculate NSSF contributions (deductions before tax)
if self.deduct_nssf:
    tier_1_nssf, tier_2_nssf, nssf_employer_contribution = calculate_nssf_contribution(
        gross_pay, effective_date=self.payment_period, formula_id=self.formula_overrides.get('nssf')
    )

# Calculate SHIF contributions (deductions before tax)
if self.deduct_nhif:
    nhif_relief, nhif_employee_contribution, employer_contribution = calculate_shif_deduction(
        gross_pay, effective_date=self.payment_period, formula_id=self.formula_overrides.get('shif')
    )

# Calculate Housing Levy (deductions before tax)
ahl_relief, hslevy_employee_contribution, levy_employer_contribution = calculate_other_deduction(
    gross_pay, title='levy', type='levy', effective_date=self.payment_period, formula_id=self.formula_overrides.get('levy')
)
```

### 2. **Income Tax Calculation Function**

#### Issue Description
The `calculate_income_tax()` function had logic errors in handling progressive tax brackets:
- Incorrect bracket sorting
- Missing proper break conditions
- Decimal precision issues

#### Fixes Implemented
- **File**: `ERPAPI/hrm/payroll/functions.py`
- **Method**: `calculate_income_tax()`
- **Changes**:
  - Added proper bracket sorting by lower limit
  - Fixed break conditions for tax bracket calculations
  - Improved decimal handling

#### Code Changes
```python
def calculate_income_tax(taxable_pay, employee_category='primary', effective_date=None, formula_id=None):
    """
    Calculate income tax using progressive tax brackets for Kenya 2025
    """
    total_tax = Decimal('0')
    tax_brackets, relief, employee_p, employe_p = load_rates(category=employee_category, title=None, type='income', effective_date=effective_date, formula_id=formula_id)

    if taxable_pay <= Decimal('0'):
        return total_tax

    # Sort brackets by lower limit to ensure proper order
    tax_brackets = sorted(tax_brackets, key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    for lower, upper, rate in tax_brackets:
        if taxable_pay <= lower:
            break  # No more tax to calculate
        
        # Calculate taxable amount for this bracket
        taxable_amount = min(upper - lower, max(Decimal('0'), taxable_pay - lower))
        tax_amount = taxable_amount * Decimal(rate)
        total_tax += tax_amount
        
        # If we've covered the entire taxable amount, break
        if taxable_pay <= upper:
            break

    return Decimal(total_tax)

            else:  # Tier 2: 8,000+ range
                tier_2_employee += employee_contribution
                tier_2_employer += employer_contribution
    
    # Round the contributions to avoid fractional values
    tier_1_employee = round(tier_1_employee)
    tier_2_employee = round(tier_2_employee)
