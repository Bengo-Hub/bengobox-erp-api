# Bengo ERP - Refactoring Guidelines & Implementation Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document provides detailed guidelines for refactoring the Bengo ERP system into a modern, scalable architecture following clean architecture principles and microservices patterns.

## 1. Refactoring Principles

### 1.1 Core Principles
- **Clean Architecture**: Separate concerns into distinct layers
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module/component has one clear purpose
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
